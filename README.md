## Description
A well structured, high- quality README is very important, especially for opensource projects. This is the first thing that visitors will see when they discover your project. This is why I created a README.md Generator. You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application. All you need to do is answer a few questions, and readme-md-generator will do the rest. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

A good README.md usually includes what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This README.md Generator I created includes those features as well as:
* A table of content
* A test section
* A questions section, that the user can add contact information.
* A license section and a license badge that appears near the top of the README.
* The ability to add a link and an image.
These features made the READM.md Generator a step up from basic.

## Installation
### Node.js
Node.js is required on your local machine. Below I have given a quick guide to get Node.js installed.

1. Open the official page for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) downloads and download Node.js for your device clicking the "Installer" option.

2. Run the downloaded Node.js Installer - including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install.

3. To ensure Node.js has been installed, run the below command in your terminal - you should get something like v6.14.10.
```bash
node -v
```
4. Update your version of npm.
```bash
npm install npm --global
```

### Node Modules
[Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package was used, run the below command in the terminal for the needed node modules.
```bash
npm install inquirer
```

## Usage
The application is invoked by using the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
When the command is invoked, the user is prompted for information about the project or the repository. The user's response is taken. A file that is formatted as a markdown is generated and is populated with the users response. See [SampleREADME.md](https://github.com/nashwalters/pro-readme-generator/blob/main/SampleREADME.md) as an example.
